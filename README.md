# HP-35s routines

## Intro

Here are some of the routines that I wrote for my HP-35s calculator. I
wrote them mostly for fun, but I also found them useful in
practice. Anything more complex is probably better solved on a real
computer, which nowadays might mean a phone if you want to keep it
portable. But a HP calculator still has a superior interface and
battery life, so I hope you find these routines useful. Also included
is a quick reference card for the routines and more advanced built-in
functions which can be printed and is dimensioned to fit into the
calculator's pouch.

## Contents

**S** — A routine for storing and restoring the stack. Used by other
  routines to avoid clobbering intermediate results.

**V** — Cross product of two vectors. Unlike the example in the
  calculator's manual which requires that you enter the six vector
  components into named variables, this routine works on HP-35s's
  native vectors (i.e. the `[]` notation).

**M** — Matrix routines that, like **V**, work with the `[]` notation
  for vectors, making data entry more comfortable.

**T** — Tabulate a function over the specified interval.

**Q** — Solve the quadratic equation.

**C** — Solve the cubic equation.

## Code organization

Each routine is in its own file named after the letter that labels the
routine. The file starts with the code so that your text editor can
provide meaningful line numbers. Each routine consists of subroutines
that also have meaningful labels in the form of equation text. These
"equations" are jumped over and never executed, so the value of flag
10 doesn't matter. They only aid the reader.

After the code comes the description of the routine, how it's meant to
be called and what the subroutines do. The "public" subroutines,
i.e. those that are meant to be called by the user directly, have GTO
statements at the begining of the main routine for easy access. For
example, the M routine, which contains matrix operations, is organized
such that you call M001 or M002 for storing a matrix, M003 recalls the
stored matrix, M004 multiplies a matrix with a vector, and so on.

Use of named variables is mostly avoided, except for I and J of
course. Unless too inconvenient, routines try to only use anonymous
memory for storage and stack for input and output. Anonymous memory is
organized into segments of ten addresses, each belonging to a letter
labeling a particular routine. The first two digits of an address are
the number of the routine's letter label. For example, routine S is
assigned addresses from 190 to 199 (although only three are actually
used). This scheme allocates memory for all possible labels, whether
they are used or not, and leaves the first 10 and the last 530
addresses free. If a routine uses any other memory, it is documented.
